How to make mean statistically sound for Array[Float] ? Taking out outlier assuming Gaussian distribution

using mean +/- 3sigma and then regenerate the mean

Linear Regression:

Normal Solver:

Ax = y
(AX - y)^t(AX - y) = (x^t A^t - y^)*(Ax - Y) = X^t A^t A x - 2 A^tY^X

Iterative Solver:

f(x) = \sum_{i = 1} ^ {N} (a_i*x_i - y_i)^2

where N are the number of rows
