KMeans clusters:
Start with random C clusters.

Step1:

For each point find the closest cluster center and assign it to the cluster center.

Step2:

Generate the new cluster centers as mean of all the points that got assigned to the cluster.

Iterate over these 2 steps.

Converge if newCenter and prevCenter sumsquared distance between them < epsilon*epsilon

NMF clusters:

LDA clusters:
